# Product Management Basics

## 1.1 What is Product Management?
Product management ensures a product succeeds by aligning teams and planning its journey. It’s the business side of creating, launching, and maintaining a product or service throughout its lifecycle. PMs ensure the product meets customer needs and company goals, guiding it through each stage.

## 1.2 Importance of Product Management
Product management bridges departments, aligning product creation with customer needs and company strategy. It involves market research, understanding customer preferences, developing product strategies, mapping plans, and collaborating across teams. PMs define product success, set strategic direction, and illustrate impact on customers and company objectives. They monitor performance and adjust to keep the product competitive and successful.

## 1.3 Product Management Lifecycle
Agile product development is cyclical. Stages often include:
- **Innovation:** Generate ideas, prioritize, and define value proposition.
- **Analysis:** Validate demand, outline requirements, build the business case.
- **Development:** Design, build, test (often in sprints).
- **Go-to-Market:** Trials, refine proposition, launch readiness.
- **In-Life:** Track sales/usage, fix issues, iterate versions.
- **End-of-Life:** Sunset when obsolete; optimize portfolio.

Typical aims: improve financial performance, reduce time-to-market, improve quality, advance the business.

## 1.4 Product Manager vs Project Manager
- **Product Manager:** Owns strategy and outcomes across the product lifecycle (research → strategy → launch → growth).
- **Project Manager:** Owns execution — scope, timeline, and delivery within a project.
PMs supervise the lifecycle; PMOs/Project Managers drive execution phases.

## 1.5 Role & Characteristics of a Product Manager
PMs sit at the intersection of **user experience, engineering, and business**. They:
- Advocate for users (research, interviews, surveys, testing).
- Define the problem, value proposition, and differentiation.
- Study competitors and market trends.
- Communicate decisions and insights to delivery teams.
- Drive innovation, quality, and revenue outcomes.

## 1.6 Ideal Workflow of a Product Manager
a. **Consumer Research:** Personas, needs, channels, trends.  
b. **Identify the Problem:** Pinpoint & validate pain points and significance.  
c. **Brainstorm:** Collaborate with engineers/marketing/customers; gather ideas.  
d. **Build the Concept:** Scope, solution outline, features, success criteria.  
e. **Product Roadmap:** Milestones, owners, metrics/KPIs, dates.  
f. **Prioritize Features:** Balance impact vs. effort; sequence work.  
g. **Implement the Plan:** Choose Agile/Waterfall; execute releases.  
h. **Rapid Prototyping & Testing:** Launch, capture feedback, iterate continuously.
