Tesla Chatbot Project:
I worked on an internal LLM-based chatbot designed to assist Tesla Customer Support agents.
The chatbot was trained on internal documentation and historical tickets to improve accuracy and reduce agent workload.
We tracked KPIs like containment rate, latency, and response accuracy.
I supported fine-tuning, CI/CD integration, and evaluation for the model pipeline.
The system reduced manual escalations by 30% and prepared for future direct-to-customer deployment.

Tesla AI Summarizer:
I led the NLP pipeline to summarize inbound calls and messages.
We used summarization and entity extraction models to classify intents such as 'Delivery Delay', 'Trade-In', and 'Payment Issues'.
This allowed proactive issue routing and reduced advisor workload by 20%.

Infineon Drone Project:
As a project coordinator, I managed software and hardware teams to validate drone motor control firmware.
We implemented SIL and HIL testing, fault injection, and performance dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana.
The CI/CD pipeline used GitLab, Jenkins, and Docker to automate builds and regression tests.
